# Project Description

This game is a mixture of the two very popular games, Snakes & Ladders and Monoply. There are two modes in the game: Design mode is where the user is able to build the playing grid and Play mode is where the players can play against each other. Four players move in a grid using snakes, ladders, and cards as the game's basic concept. The players land on special cells (cards) that can either be good or bad. The goal of the player is to be the first person to reach the final cell.

## Cards:

        <tr>
            <td>Card 9</td>
            <td>Gives the player the option to buy this cell and all cells containing a card with the same number. For example, if a player chooses to buy a cell with Card10, he will own all cells having a Card10.</td>
