# Project Description

This game is a mixture of the two very popular games, Snakes & Ladders and Monoply. There are two modes in the game: Design mode is where the user is able to build the playing grid and Play mode is where the players can play against each other. Four players move in a grid using snakes, ladders, and cards as the game's basic concept. The players land on special cells (cards) that can either be good or bad. The goal of the player is to be the first person to reach the final cell.

## Cards:

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Card 1</td>
            <td>Decrements the value of the passing playerâ€™s wallet by a value specified when creating the grid.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Card 2</td>
            <td>Moves the player forward to the start of the next ladder in the grid. If no ladders ahead, do nothing.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Card 3</td>
            <td>Gives the player an extra dice roll.</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Card 9</td>
            <td>Gives the player the option to buy this cell and all cells containing a card with the same number. For example, if a player chooses to buy a cell with Card10, he will own all cells having a Card10.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Card 10</td>
            <td>Same as card 9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Card 11</td>
            <td>Same as card 9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Card 12</td>
            <td>This card moves the ownership of the most expensive station that the current user owns from the current user to the player that has the least amount of coins in his wallet.</td>
